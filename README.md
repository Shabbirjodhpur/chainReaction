# chainReaction
->This is my remake of the old date game chain reaction made in pure Vanilla javascript.
->It has a simple Structure containing 
      ->index.html
      ->index.js
      ->style.css
->The index.js contains all the code of the file which is patterned on the following order:
    ->The state of the board is stored in an array
    ->Every time a button is clicked an event listener is triggered changing the state array which in turn renders itself in the html.
    ->The core game logic is in the clickUpdate Function.
->The index.html has the follwing pattern:
    ->The game is in the form of a 10x10 matrix of buttons.
