# chainReaction
1.This is my remake of the old date game chain reaction made in pure Vanilla javascript.
2.It has a simple Structure containing 
      a.index.html
      b.index.js
      c.style.css
3.The index.js contains all the code of the file which is patterned on the following order:
    a.The state of the board is stored in an array
    b.Every time a button is clicked an event listener is triggered changing the state array which in turn renders itself in the html.
    c.The core game logic is in the clickUpdate Function.
4.The index.html has the follwing pattern:
    a.The game is in the form of a 10x10 matrix of buttons.
